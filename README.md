- Completion rate analytics
- Data persistence between sessions

### 2. 🔬 Advanced Scientific Calculator (calculator_app.py)
A comprehensive calculator with multiple modes:
- 🧮 Basic arithmetic operations
- 🔬 Scientific functions (trigonometry, logarithms, etc.)
- 📝 Expression evaluator with mathematical constants
- 🔄 Unit converter (Length, Weight, Temperature)
- 📚 Calculation history
- 📊 Mathematical constants reference

*Key Features:*
- Support for complex mathematical expressions
- Multiple calculation modes in one application
- Built-in unit conversions
- History tracking for all calculations

### 3. 🔐 Advanced Password Generator (password_generator.py)
A security-focused password generation tool:
- 🎛 Fully customizable password criteria
- 🔤 Passphrase generator for memorable passwords
- 🛡 Password strength analysis with security scoring
- 📊 Bulk password generation (up to 50 at once)
- 📚 Generation history tracking
- 🔒 Security tips and best practices

*Key Features:*
